The App created was designed so users can compare their age with famous people who have passed away. It has a simple and easy to understand interface where users would enter their age in the blank space then click on the “generate history” button and the result if matching will display the name of a famous person in history and a sentence describing what they where known for. For example if a user where to enter the age “39” and then clicks on the “generate history” button the result will display “Martin Luther King Junior- A prominent figure in the the American civil rights movement from 1995 to 1968”. However, if users enter an age that contants a decimal number eg “25.5” then click on the “generate history” button the result which will then be displayed will be “Error- Only add age as a whole number, please try again”. Additionally, if users enter an age that is not within the range of 20 to 100 years old, such as “18” and then click on the “generate history” button the result which will then be displayed will be “Error- Age should be between the range of 20 years old and 100 years old, please try again”.
